	<div class="wrapper">
		<h2 class="wrapper__inner--medium">San Francisco</h2>
		<h6 class="wrapper__inner--medium">September 2018</h6>
		
		<div class="wrapper__space--small"></div>

		<p class="wrapper__inner--medium wrapper__intro">In this cultural melting pot you have the art galleries, the Symphony, the Opera and the playhouses. All of which render fabulous, even unconventional, depictions of the arts in its many forms.</p>

		<h3 class="wrapper__section-heading">Biscuits &#38; Blues</h3>
		<p class="wrapper__inner--medium">When I’m in San Francisco I almost always hit up this tiny, dark little blues club called Biscuits &#38; Blues. It’s a great spot to have a drink as the funky ‘whaaaa-whaaaa’ of the harp (<em>read: harmonica</em>) as it laces a classic blues track with a slathering of funk. It’s a great excuse to let your hair down and let your worries fade away, at least in the moment, to feel the blues in your soul on a deeply personal and enigmatic level. But maybe that’s just me!</p>

		<h3 class="wrapper__section-heading">Fisherman's Wharf</h3>
		<p class="wrapper__inner--medium">Let’s start this adventure at Fisherman’s Wharf. This is where you'll find some of the most delicious and freshest Dungeness Crab. A local favorite here as because of the delicate texture and mildly sweet, buttery flavor. OMG! Sooo <strong>good</strong>! You have to try this,  seafood lovers. But be careful as you just might become addicted, they’re <em>that</em> good! So, needless to say, if you’re anywhere near the wharf then do yourself a huge favor and indulge in anything Dungeness Crab. I went to the bay area looking for the BEST crabcakes in SF and, upon the advice of a local, was directed to Scoma’s (est. 1965, Al Scoma Way Pier 47, Fisherman’s Wharf). The crabcakes were lightly fried with a delicate, crisp exterior followed by the mildly sweet, buttery flavor of the moist and tender crabmeat. IT. WAS. DELICIOUS. If you can find this place, go!</p>

		<h3 class="wrapper__section-heading">Union Square, Downtown</h3>
		<p class="wrapper__inner--medium">The place is Magic! On the weekends you can find the square lined with vendors selling goods varying from jewelry to clothing to food to paintings. There are painting classes with local artists, musical or otherwise from every culture, era, or walk of life. It’s a sight to behold and hard to fathom, if you really think about it. In Union square, you get a sense of what it’s like to live in this city. An experience of memorable proportions and should be on your bucket list of excursions.</p>

		<h3 class="wrapper__section-heading">La Scala's</h3>
		<p class="wrapper__inner--medium">Just up the street from the square you can find an Italian restaurant, connected to the Sir Francis Drake Hotel, called La Scala’s. If you have the opportunity this is another of many <em>fantastic</em> places to eat! Very classy yet casual interior with an expertly trained staff to offer you a pleasurable dining experience. I had the halibut and was blown away by the gorgeous presentation as well as the buttery, rich and somehow still lite, flavor. It looked and tasted absolutely delicious.</p>

		<h3 class="wrapper__section-heading">There’s also North Beach</h3>
		<p class="wrapper__inner--medium">Otherwise known as little Italy. Here you can find some of the most authentic flavors of Italy and feel the pulse of the Italian-American community. Italian Americans have resided here since the great earthquake (7.9 magnitude) of 1906. The earthquake destroyed much of- the bay area leaving everything in ruins only to be rebuilt, by immigrants working alongside locals, into the thriving metropolis that it is today.</p>

		<h3 class="wrapper__section-heading">The Famed Castro District</h3>
		<p class="wrapper__inner--medium">Bright, colorful and full of life! A beacon for every ‘alternative’ lifestyle. It feels a bit strange to say alternative in SF. You will notice when in the city, walking amongst the locals, ‘alternative’ is the accepted norm here and it feels, well… quite normal. But really, what is normal? And who gets to decides that? And why? This bright, lively and happy neighborhood was one of the first gay neighborhoods in the United States as well as home to a personally beloved shop selling delicious and playfully named cookies, <a href="https://hotcookiebakery.com/" target="_blank">Hot Cookie</a>, home to the chocolate delite known as ‘The Fudge Packer’ and the gluten-free ‘Hunky Monkey’, a mixture of peanut butter and chocolate, or even something a bit more subdued (in name, not flavor) like the peanut butter, snickerdoodle, or chocolate chip cookies. From the rainbow crosswalk to the rainbow flags decorating nearly every wall or business, there’s definitely no question as to the sexual proclivities of this neighborhood. It’s wonderful to see how far we’ve come as a nation. YaY!!</p>

		<h3 class="wrapper__section-heading">The Ferry Building</h3>
		<p class="wrapper__inner--medium">1 Embarcadero is home to an assortment of businesses from food and wine to soap and cheese. An offering of all things pleasurable to the human senses, mmm &#128516;. There’s a place called the Cowgirl Creamery, co-founded by veterans of the kitchen Peggy Smith, of Chez Panisse and Sue Conley, Chef/Co-Founder of Bette’s Oceanview Diner. A cheese lovers paradise, the Cowgirl Creamery is located next door to the Cowgirl Sidekick Cafe and Milkbar. Aptly named, this is a deli-style restaurant that uses the cheese and dairy products from next door at the Cowgirl Creamery. At the sidekick Cafe, a person can find some of the most expertly prepared sandwiches, but the grilled cheese sandwiches here will always reign supreme in my book. Go here and have one for lunch, these sandwiches are simply <strong>DELICIOUS</strong>! A ‘must try’!</p>

		<p class="wrapper__inner--medium">As you stroll along the halls of the ferry building you will undoubtedly run across the Ferry Plaza Wine Merchants. Here, there is a significance placed upon the wines of Northern-California and the Pacific-Northwest. But never fear, you can still find good wines from around the world! This is a popular weekend/after-work, mid-day or anytime hangout and another ‘must try’ for any wine lover. <em>Sure, I’ll have another glass!</em></p>

		<p class="wrapper__inner--medium">Thank you for letting me share these experiences with you and if you ever make it to San Francisco hopefully this will leave you a few decent recommendations or at least help to guide you in the right direction within this wonderful city.</p>

		<p class="wrapper__inner--medium">Stay tuned for more.</p>
